# Hi, I'm Vivaan Srivastav
Welcome to my ICS4U portfolio. I’ll use this site to post my work and reflections.

## Highlights
- 🔧 Project 1: ICS3U Culminating – A 3D ray casting game created using Java Swing. 
- 🧠 Concept I learned: I learned how to use Java Swing to a very high degree. I also learned the concept of ray casting, a vary smart method for creating a 3D game when given a simple 2D enviroment. I also applied the concept of a BFS algorithm to optimize the path of the enemy to the player.
